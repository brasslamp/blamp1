<h2>CSS</h2>
I am trying to learn <strong>very basics of coding. <u><a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/specs.en.html" target="_blank" title="CSS specification">CSS link here</a></u></strong>
<br><strong><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/" target="_blank" title="CSS Tutorial">CSS</strong></a> is the language we use to style an HTML document.
<br>CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed.
<br>This tutorial will teach you CSS from basic to advanced.
<br>I rarely drink coffee but I was just too tired so I had a half caf coffee 5 hours ago, which surprisingly not doing much so now I'm having diet coke. I did harry potter house quiz and I got ravenclaw so hope that means I'm smart enough for this. I'm supposed to write things down bit more but I have nothing to write down so this is me just typing whatever. still tired and have no idea why. I had 9 hours sleep last night and how come..like..how...?

<p>I am also making gloves I can use when I blow dry my hair as my cheap ass blow dryer only have super hot temperature option so my hand is always burning. The reason for me making it instead of buying it is because I am broke, I'm not actually but it kind of feels like it all the time. I blame my dad. I mean..it's good to save money but I can be little bit excessive on saving money sometimes.
